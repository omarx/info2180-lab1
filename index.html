    <h2>Omar Peart</h2>
    <p>
        Originating from the vibrant city of Kingston, Jamaica,
        I am a 26-year-old innovative web developer. My foundation in this field is cemented by a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
        supplemented by a Minor in Economics, both of which I am pursing from the prestigious University of the West Indies.
        Presently, I specialize in full stack and mobile development, exhibiting proficiency in multiple programming languages including Java, Javascript, and Python.
        My holistic understanding of technology coupled with a passion for creative problem-solving drives my commitment towards designing and developing seamless, user-centric digital solutions.</p>
